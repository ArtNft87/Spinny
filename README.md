# Spinny Roulette 🎰

Spinny Roulette is a lightweight web app that merges entertainment with social sharing. Players spin the wheel, receive a win or loss outcome, and can instantly share meme-based results to X (Twitter). 

The game is designed for **engagement virality**, combining animations, sound effects, and randomized outcomes with one-click sharing. Future updates will introduce gamification elements like streaks, rewards, and a global leaderboard.
